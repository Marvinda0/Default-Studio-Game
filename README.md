# Libera Me From Hell ðŸŽ®

This is a college project made by four students for a class. The game is about a player trying to escape from hell by clearing rooms, fighting enemies, collecting items, and leveling up to get stronger. We're still learning Unity as we go, so the game is a work in progress.
